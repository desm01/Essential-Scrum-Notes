Scrum Framework:
Chapter - 2...

  Overview
Scrum is not a standardised process. It's a FRAMEWORK. Based on a set of values,
End version is totally unique.

Scrum Roles:
Scrum development involves one or more Scrum dev teams. 
  - Three main roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master & Dev team
  - Manager role still exists. Scrum bolts onto existing org.

Product owner:
Empowered central point of Products leadership. Single responsibility for deciding which features get added / scraped.
Communicates vision of what we build. Responsible for success.
Ensures most valuable work is completed. -> Works closely with Dev team / ScrumMaster. 
Works to answer quesions asap.

ScrumMaster:
Helps everyone involved embrace Scrum values and principles. Provides process leadership.
Helps team develop own processes / best practices.
Helps team deal with scope mutation / change.
Protects team from outside interference. 
Leadership role in removing impediments.
No authority over team. Can't exert control.
Leader -> Not manager

Dev Team:
Architect, programmer, UX, database etc... 
Diverse definition as Scrum works in many organisations.
Dev Team is CROSS functional
Members need to have all the skills to make good stuff. 
Teams best to be small. 5-9 people. All self-organising.

Scrum activities & Artifacts:

Aside -> Much debate over commitments or forecast in defintion when planning. 
Forecast should dictate Commitment.

Team members assemble sprint backlog. A list of items that need completed to meet the sprint commitment.
Each day the team synchronise, inspect & plan with each other: three big Qs. Yesterday, today, help?

Team completes sprint by doing two activites:
  - Sprint review -> Product owner gets feedback from stakeholders
  - Sprint retro -> Look back on Sprint progress.

Product Backlog:
  - Prioritised by product owner.
  - Stack -> Top most pressing.
  - Sprint grooming -> Estimate and prioritise
  - Story points / Days estimate used.

Sprint:
  - Fixed end date
  - Time-boxed (Business needs get in the way)

Sprint Planning:
  - Backlog contains many months of work.
  - Entire team collaborates to decide what to put in next Sprint. (Goal based)
  - Reasonable estimates important. Comfortable pace of work.
  - Breaking tasks down into sub-tasks is a type of Just in time planning. Added to Sprint backlog
  - 

Sprint execution:
  - ScrumMaster happy that all tasks are completed succesfully
  - ScrumMaster coaches
  - Team members define their own workflow (Self organise)
